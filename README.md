In this activity, you will find that the user will find themselves at a start screen. On the screen the user is given instructions for the Code Quiz Challenge. Below the instructions is a start button to initiate the quiz.


Then the user will be prompted with a series of questions that will ultimately add or subtract the time left. At the end of the game, the remaining time will decide what the users final score is.

After the game is over, the user will have an input box, where they are able to add in their initials to store on the scoreboard.
